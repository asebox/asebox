This is the README file for the SDK/Open Server scripts.

This directory contains the following script(s):

copylibs.bat:
	As of SDK 15.0 and Open Server 15.0, Sybase library names have
	changed from lib<name> to libsyb<name> to avoid name clashes
	with other libraries.

	To allow pre-15.0 applications to continue to work with the
	renamed shared libraries, this script is provided to copy the
	new library names to the old ones in %SYBASE%\%SYBASE_OCS%\dll.

	Usage of the script:

	   copylibs.bat { create / remove }

	where 'create' copies the old-named files in $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/dll
	and 'remove' can be used to delete these files again.
