BlueShoes JavaScript Checkbox Component
=======================================

NOTE: 

 - If you use this as standalone package then you may want to 
   change the javascript include path (which currently is 
   /_bsJavascript/components/checkbox/) to something else. 
   see the examples.

 - This component is needed in the "tree" component if the 
   checkbox feature is used.
